When visiting the page with q=hello PHP throws a warning because it tries to scan the folder called "hello" but this folder doesn't exist in my droplet.Because of this , PHP shows warnings about not being able to open or read the directory.

the Warnings are 

Warning:  scandir(hello): Failed to open directory: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/directory_traversal_part1.php on line 9



Warning:  scandir(): (errno 2): No such file or directory in /var/www/html/directory_traversal_part1.php on line 9



As for what is sensitive 
The page exposes internal server file paths (e.g., /var/www/html/directory_traversal_part1.php) and PHP error messages. 
This is sensitive because attackers can learn about the server's folder structure the presence of files and exploit directory traversal or other vulnerabilities based on this information.
