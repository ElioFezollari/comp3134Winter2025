When the input is Ben, the page tries to find users with the name Ben that are active. My database does not have any so it finds no records.
When the input is Ben'--, the input is treated as a normal string because the program uses prepared statements. The database searches for a user with the exact first name Ben'-- and active status 1. Since no such user exists, it finds no records.
When the input is Ben' or 1=1, the input again is treated as a normal string. The database searches for a user whose first name is exactly Ben' or 1=1 and active status 1. Since there is no user with that exact name, no records are found.
